# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the *Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics* textbook — a practical, project-driven course designed to teach you how to design, simulate, and control humanoid robots using modern AI techniques.  

The emergence of Physical Artificial Intelligence marks a pivotal transformation in the relationship between intelligent computation and embodied action. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital or simulated environments, Physical AI integrates perception, cognition, and action within physical agents capable of interacting autonomously with the real world. This paradigm shift brings together machine learning, biomechanics, control theory, materials science, and cognitive systems engineering to create robots that move, adapt, and reason with a level of fluency previously limited to biological organisms.

Humanoid robotics occupies a central role within this transition. By adopting human-like morphology and sensorimotor architectures, humanoid robots serve as both functional tools and experimental platforms for understanding locomotion, dexterity, decision-making, and social interaction. Their design demands rigor across multiple domains: high-precision actuation, compliant mechanisms, multimodal perception, real-time control, and scalable learning architectures. Each subsystem must operate within the constraints of physical laws while achieving intelligence that is robust, interpretable, and deployable in real environments.

This textbook provides a comprehensive and research-driven foundation for the study of Physical AI and humanoid systems. It emphasizes verifiable principles, reproducible methodologies, and engineering practices grounded in peer-reviewed evidence and established standards. Readers will progress from the theoretical basis of embodied intelligence to the practical design, simulation, and deployment of advanced humanoid platforms. With a focus on clarity, academic rigor, and cross-disciplinary integration, this work aims to equip students, researchers, and practitioners with the knowledge required to build the next generation of physically intelligent machines.

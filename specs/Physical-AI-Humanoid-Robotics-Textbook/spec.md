# Feature Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Structure

**Feature Branch**: `feature/ai-robotics-textbook`
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create the complete empty folder and file structure..."

## Purpose
Establish the complete empty folder and file structure for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project, adhering to Docusaurus v3 standards, integrating Spec-Kit Plus components, and preparing for GitHub Pages deployment and RAG chatbot integration. This foundational structure will facilitate subsequent content creation and development.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Project Structure Initialization (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to initialize the project with the specified Docusaurus v3 structure, including all necessary config files for GitHub Pages, separate folders for specs, chapters, assets, and the RAG backend, so that I have a clean and organized foundation to start content creation and development.

**Why this priority**: Essential for setting up the project and enabling all subsequent development work.

**Independent Test**: The entire folder and file structure is created as specified, Docusaurus config files are present, and the repository is ready for GitHub Pages deployment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** the project root is `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook`, **When** the structure is created, **Then** all specified folders and placeholder files exist with correct naming and hierarchy.
2.  **Given** the Docusaurus config files are in place, **When** a Docusaurus `build` command is run (hypothetically, without content), **Then** it completes without critical errors related to configuration.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

-   **FR-001**: The project MUST have a root folder named `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-textbook`.
-   **FR-002**: The project MUST adhere to Docusaurus v3 structure.
-   **FR-003**: All necessary configuration files for immediate GitHub Pages deployment MUST be included (e.g., `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`).
-   **FR-004**: Separate folders for `specs`, `docs` (for chapters), `static` (for assets), and a `rag-chatbot` directory (for the RAG backend) MUST be present at the project root or within the Docusaurus structure as appropriate.
-   **FR-005**: Placeholder files for bonus features (e.g., authentication, personalization, Urdu translation) MUST be included in appropriate, standard Docusaurus locations (e.g., `src/plugins/auth`, `src/theme/personalization`, `i18n/ur`).
-   **FR-006**: A `.gitignore` file MUST be present at the project root.
-   **FR-007**: A `README.md` file MUST be present at the project root.
-   **FR-008**: A deployment workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) MUST be present for GitHub Pages.

### Key Entities

-   **Project Root**: The top-level directory containing all project files.
-   **Docusaurus Site**: The static site generated by Docusaurus, including documentation, blog, and custom pages.
-   **RAG Chatbot Backend**: The FastAPI application responsible for vectorization, retrieval, and LLM interaction.
-   **GitHub Pages**: The deployment target for the static Docusaurus site.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

-   **SC-001**: The complete empty folder and file structure matches the specified Docusaurus v3 layout, including `specs`, `docs`, `static`, `rag-chatbot`, `.github/workflows`, `.gitignore`, and `README.md` (verified by `ls -R` output).
-   **SC-002**: All Docusaurus configuration files (e.g., `docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`) are present at their correct locations within the Docusaurus site structure.
-   **SC-003**: Placeholder files for bonus features (authentication, personalization, Urdu translation) and the GitHub Pages deployment workflow file are correctly placed within the generated structure.
